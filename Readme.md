<h2><u>DESCRIPTION</u></h2>

I have created a web application called MediSite using CSS, HTML, JavaScript.
It helps the public to look into the various services/facilities offered by the hospital. 
The index page can be divided into six pages namely Home, About, Facilties, Laboratory ,Clients and contact.
We can either scroll down to the respective section or click on the button at the top to directly jump to the section. 
Suppose we need a certain treatment, usually we need to travel a long distance to reach the hospital and inquire whether they the facility. 
This is both time consuming and risky. Instead, using the site, we can go to laboratory section to know which treatments are available in the hospital and then decide. 
This reduces any risk of exposure in these pandemic times. Since the project is already deployed, anyone with the link can access the site from anywhere.
Any user can also contact the staff using the number or email. 
He/She can also write email elaborating the issue.
This helps people who cannot physically come to the hospital.
